# Coen160_FinalProject

Project goal was to implement a simulator for a recycling company. There were two individual simulators, one representing the individual recycling machines and the other representing the centralized machine that controlled each individual recycling machine. Given specific criteria, we implemented our simulators. 

The individual recycling machine (RCM) had the ability to accept items based on the type and return a specified amount of money. Each RCM had a certain weight limit it could hold and amount of money it could return. 

The centralized machine (RMOS) controlled each individual machine allowing updating of each machines accepted items, clearing the weight, and adding more money. It could add and delete individual RCMs as well as maintained various usage statistics about the RCMs.
